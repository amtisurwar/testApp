flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 50px\">\n  <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7840686/32702785-b1d9114e-c7a0-11e7-9999-6c6a00d432ec.gif\" width=\"280\" />\n  <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7840686/32702789-b6bbdce6-c7a0-11e7-8034-8144274fbdae.gif\" width=\"280\" />\n  <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7840686/32702791-b947eedc-c7a0-11e7-8e8c-7dff1bd80564.gif\" width=\"280\" />\n</div>\n<br /><br />\n\nIf this sounds interesting and you would like to participate, kindly open a\n**new issue with the design & spec of the UI screen** that you need to be\ndeveloped. One of our developers will respond to your issue with an estimate of\ntime & cost.\n\nIt's built on top of **RNE & Open Collective**. If you have any feedback or\nwould like to know more details about this kindly contact\n**[Monte Thakkar](https://github.com/Monte9)**.\n\n## React Native Web support\n\nAs a cross platform UI Toolkit, you can now use RNE on the web & share your codebase between your React Native + React web apps. RNE components are rendered perfectly on browser. You can achieve this to target iOS, Android and Web by collaborating RNE and [React Native for Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web).\n\nClick [here](https://react-native-elements.github.io/react-native-elements/blog/2018/12/13/react-native-web.html) for a full walkthrough using React Native Elements + React Native Web.\n\n## Expo Demo App\n\nCheckout the official\n[React Native Elements App](https://expo.io/@monte9/react-native-elements-app)\non Expo which uses all of the React Native Elements components.\n\nIf you are looking to contribute to the React Native Elements App, click\n[here](https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements-app) to\nview the implementation & run the RNE expo app locally.\n\n## Documentation\n\n[View the full docs here](https://react-native-elements.github.io/react-native-elements/docs/overview.html)\n\n## Contributing\n\nInterested in contributing to this repo?

production? If so, consider supporting this project as it will allow the maintainers to dedicate more time to maintaining this project and also building new features for everyone. Also, your app or company's logo will show [on GitHub](https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements#sponsors) and link to your website - who doesn't want a little extra exposure?
